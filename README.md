## Welcome to SSC Helsinki meetup info page

We are a group of readers of the blog [SlateStarCodex](http://slatestarcodex.com/) by Scott Alexander / Yvain. We are active in the Helsinki area and have been meeting approximately ~once per month (since April 2017) at Oluthuone Kaisla.

### Contact

If you are interested, you can reach us by:

* Emailing the organizer-ish person at: sschelsinkimeetup (at) gmail.com
* Request access to [Google group email list thingy](https://groups.google.com/group/ssc-helsinki-meetup-google-group). (We mostly discuss the next meetup details.)

Future meetups will be also listed on [the repository](https://ssc-meetups-community.github.io/meetups/) and advertized in the latest [open thread](http://slatestarcodex.com/tag/open/?latest) and other relevant corners of the internet.
