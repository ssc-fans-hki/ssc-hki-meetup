## Welcome to SSC Helsinki meetup info page

We are a group of readers of the blog [SlateStarCodex](http://slatestarcodex.com/) by Scott Alexander / Yvain. We are active in the Helsinki area and have been meeting approximately ~once per month (since April 2017) at Oluthuone Kaisla.

### Contact

If you are interested, you can reach us by:

* Emailing the organizer-ish person at: sschelsinkimeetup (at) gmail.com
* Request access to [Google group email list thingy](https://groups.google.com/group/ssc-helsinki-meetup-google-group). (We mostly discuss the next meetup details.)

The tentative monthly meetup dates (the 4th Tuesday every month) can be found [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=sschelsinkimeetup%40gmail.com&ctz=Europe/Helsinki). (Or simply scroll down.) The link to [ical feed here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/sschelsinkimeetup%40gmail.com/public/basic.ics).

If you are interested, please RSVP to the email above or on the Google group. The meetups that are confirmed to happen (= number of participants n > 1) will be marked as "confirmed" approx. a week before (hopefully earlier).

Future meetups will be also listed on [the repository](https://ssc-meetups-community.github.io/meetups/) and advertised in the latest [open thread](http://slatestarcodex.com/tag/open/?latest) and other relevant corners of the internet.
